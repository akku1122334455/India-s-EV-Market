# India-s-EV-Market
This project is based on india's electric vehicle market segmentation<br>
The EV market in India is growing fast. Electric two-wheelers, like scooters and bikes, are the most popular because theyâ€™re affordable and practical. Electric cars and three-wheelers are also starting to gain more attention. However, there are still challenges, such as high prices and not enough charging stations. The government is supporting this shift with incentives and policies, and new companies are entering the market.
